### Date created
28th April 2023

### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
The project is about creating an interactive experience for the user in order to explore **US Bikeshare Data**, choosing a city among Chicago, New York and Washington.

The user is asked to choose a city to be analyzed and also enter the day and month he wants to consider.

The program then provides descriptive statistics about the chosen dataset, such as the most frequent times of travel, trip duration and popular stations.

At the end the user is asked if he wants the program to display the first 5 rows of the dataset: if he types _yes_ these rows are displayed and then he can choose to view the following 5 rows and so on. This process terminates when the user types _no_.
